        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>  
             Lasagna is a rich and comforting Italian casserole made by alternating layers of wide,
             flat pasta sheets, a savory meat or vegetable sauce (usually a rich Bolognese), 
             and a creamy cheese filling (often Ricotta or Bechamel sauce), 
             topped with a generous amount of Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. It's a perfect dish for a family dinner or a special occasion.

        <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Meat Sauce (Bolognese)</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Add the oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes (up to 1 hour for richer flavor), stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Noodles (If Needed)</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>you are using regular lasagna noodles (not oven-ready), cook them according to the package directions until al dente. Drain them and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Mix the Ricotta Filling</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the Ricotta cheese, egg, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well combined.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Preheat and Prepare</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375∘F (≈190∘C).</li>
                <li>Lightly grease a 9×13-inch (or similar size) baking dish.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>First Layer (Sauce): Spread about 1 cup of the meat sauce evenly across the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Second Layer (Noodles): Lay 3 lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Third Layer (Ricotta): Spread half of the Ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Fourth Layer (Meat & Cheese): Spread about 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over the Ricotta, then sprinkle with about 1 cup of Mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Repeat: Add 3 more noodles, the rest of the Ricotta mixture, another 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, and another 1 cup of Mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Final Layer: Top with the last 3 noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and the last cup of Mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Bake and Serve</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for another 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly, golden brown, and the lasagna is heated through.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps it set and makes it much easier to serve neatly.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
