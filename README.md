# odin-recipes

In this project, i'm going to make a page for recipes and i'll apply everything i've learned about HTML, Git and Github.

HTML:
Basic Structure of HTML: Html, head, body, footer etc.
How to use Tags 
Types of Tags: Input and output tags, Void Tags
Paragraphs, bold, cursive.
Link and images: Relative Links and Absolute Links
Atributes: Href, src etc.

Git and Github:

Git is a powerful, distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks changes to files over time. It allows me to:

Track History: See exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when.

Revert Changes: Easily go back to a previous, stable version of the code if something goes wrong.

Work Independently: Use branches to develop new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

The core of my workflow involves a few fundamental commands:

Command	Purpose
git init	Initializes a new local Git repository in the current directory.
git status	Shows the current state of the repository (e.g., modified, staged files).
git add <file>	Stages changes (prepares them) to be included in the next commit.
git commit -m "message"	Permanently records the staged changes with a descriptive message.
git log	Displays a history of commits for the repository.


What is GitHub?
GitHub is a popular web-based platform that provides remote hosting for Git repositories. It acts as a central hub for projects, enabling collaboration and sharing. My experience with GitHub includes:

Remote Storage: Pushing my local Git repository to a remote server for backup and accessibility.

Collaboration: Allowing others to view, contribute to, or fork the project.

Project Management: Utilizing features like Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

My basic remote workflow involves:

Command	Purpose	
git remote add origin <URL>	Connects the local repository to a remote repository on GitHub (often named origin).	
git push origin <branch>	Uploads (sends) local commits to the remote repository.	
git pull origin <branch>	Downloads (fetches and merges) changes from the remote repository to the local one.	
git clone <URL>	Creates a complete local copy of an existing remote repository.
